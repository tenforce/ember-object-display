Deprecation note
---

This add-on underwent a huge refactoring to make working with it a lot simpler. The deprecated classes are kept for now as a reference, and just in case not everything was ported. Do not use them to implement new functionality.

The new version is [ember-concept-display](https://git.tenforce.com/mu-semtech/ember-concept-display).
